  	The following queue has been included for sample purposes.  To use this queue in the ESB,
  	uncomment the following block of code.  It is suggested that the name of 'SampleJMSQueue'
  	also be altered to something more meaningful to the project.  To create more queues, simply
  	make a copy of the following code and add it to this file.  Topics can be created in a similar
  	way. 
  	
  	To fully implement queues in this ESB application, see the deployment.xml descriptor
  	in the src/main/resources/META-INF directory
