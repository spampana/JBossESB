 In step 1, the JMS client send a raw JMS message to the queue "queue/eclipse_quickstart_helloworld_Request_gw".

The JMS listener receives the raw JMS message (step 2) and adapts the message to the ESB aware message format, 
but before doing this, it needs to know the endpoint of the Service. So the JMS listener first contact (step 3) 
the Service Registry  (that keeps track of all Service Endpoints References), then normalize the message and 
place in the the JMS queue "queue/eclipse_quickstart_helloworld_Request_esb"  (step 4)

When the message is placed in this queue the Service "MyJMSListenerAction" is triggered and the content of the 
Message is extracted and passed to the displayMessage (see step 5).

If all steps performed are successfull you should see a dump on the Server Console of the JMS message 
sent to the Queue.
